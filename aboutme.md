Throughout history, humans have used violence and intimidation, especially against civilians, in the pursuit of political and ideological aims. This idea defines terrorism, which has had a significant impact on society and culture. It is fair to assume that cinema portrays diverse cultures, lifestyles and issues, reflecting society, its joys, struggles, and complexities. Through films, we witness stories that resonate with our own experiences, making us feel connected and understood, and allowing us to learn more about what is happening in our world. In this context, terrorism has been portrayed in multiple movies. It is interesting to investigate the impact that terrorism has had on cinema, using the CMU Movie corpus dataset and focusing on emotional depiction, genre association, topic patterns, as well as popularity across continents and countries.
